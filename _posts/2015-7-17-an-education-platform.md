I have slowly been working on improving a small app I built for my senior
project class though it was as much for the class as it was for me. It is my
attempt to replace Blackboard which has been my most loathed education platform
(and only one I have had the misfortune of using). I, being a student
personally, think I would be a better candidate for creating an education
platform. Though I haven't had input from any teachers yet but will absolutely
enjoy their oppinions. It will include many things like push notifications for
updates to courses you are presently taking, direct messaging so teachers can
talk directly to students outside the class room and faster than email,
a forum area (one level) allowing students to ask questions and have other
students or teachers answer, a blog area for teachers to directly push
updates/info to students without extra clutter like comments from other
students which should be addressed withing the forum area and so much more!
