I don't know about the rest of the coders out there but, I am still trying to
improve my understanding of computer languages as a whole. With this comes
understanding, of corse, and these weird moments when I stop writing a line for
a second and go "is this really going to work", then continue on to think when
it does, "it actually was that simple.". I guess after years of coding it's
nice to be able to actually get things done you want to get done instead of
having to keep tinkering with it continuously until it finally works. This blog
for example just amazed me in many different ways. It's amazing how small the
code for this blog actually is. And the speed potential behind it is quite
amazing also.
