Wrote a small tutorial of LiveScript + Expressjs on
<a href="http://runnable.com/U-BNRWxYIUI1kA6M" data-ignore="push">runnable</a>.
Just incase you didn't know what
<a href="http://LiveScript.net" data-ignore="push">LiveScript</a> was, it's a
beautifully designed language which allows for so much more elegance than
either javascript or coffeescript could manage. It allows for backcalls,
<code>for</code> loops <code>of</code> lists, objects, and only run the loop
<code>when</code> x is true. Just a simply amazing language I just have fallen
in love with.
